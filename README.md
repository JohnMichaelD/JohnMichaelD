  # Hi there, I'm John 👋

I'm a full stack developer with an eye for design. I enjoy building all sorts of projects, and I'm super passionate in making sure it not only looks good, but also works as intended! When I'm not coding, I spend most of my time outdoors, scuba diving, or enjoying the arts! 


- 🔭 I’m currently working on a fullstack app that tracks your contact lens usage. [Check it out!](https://johnmichaeld.github.io/contact-Solution/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js, Three.js and Bootstrap, while practicing my skills in JavaScript ES6, HTML5, CSS3!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a cave diver & scuba instructor!
- 👨‍💻 Open to work opportunities! Check out my [portfolio](https://johnmichaeld.github.io/portfolio/)! 
- 🌎 A 2022 Goal: Contributre more to Open Source Projects!
