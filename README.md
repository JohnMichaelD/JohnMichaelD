  #<div align="center"> Hi there, I'm John 👋 </div>

I'm a full stack developer with an eye for design. I enjoy building all sorts of projects, and super passionate in making sure it not only looks good, but works well! When I'm not coding, I spend most of my time outdoors, scuba diving, or enjoying the arts!


- 🔭 I’m currently working on a fullstack app that tracks your contact lens usage. [Check it out!](https://johnmichaeld.github.io/contact-Solution/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js, Three.js and Bootstrap, while practicing my skills JavaScript ES6, HTML5, CSS3!
